        <p>Renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, has this to say about his 
            profession:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in 
           what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>
            <p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written 
           down – it's not something that is tampered with – and yet, each 
           conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in 
           the interpretation.</p>

            This          is an           example of 
             text        with a lot of
                                               curious
             whitespace.
